## Tasks

1. Build ordered list as presented on 1.png.
2. Change the font size of the list element to 24px and set font to 'sans-serif'. Also the number before the list should have color (green/red) appropriate to the value given in the list - see 2.png.
3. Create a container that has 400px width and black border. Put the list and the form inside the box and align them as on the design (see 3.png). Spacing between elements and the container border is 16px. Accesibility for the form is a bonus.
4. Program the button so that after clicking the filter button, it will copy and append original list however only selected values will be visible. Other should be visually hidden - see 4.png. Clicking on the filter button should work multiple times.
5. Fetch data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. Display a list of usernames and their emails - see 5.png.
